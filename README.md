<br>
There are some missing assignments that were lost due to a drive failure.

HTML Section
============
The HTML section was the sortest section of the class. It consisted of only one week to understand the basic tags
used for HTML.

CSS
===
CSS was a majority of the class. In doing so, it expanted more in depth to HTML tags and their properties that can
be edited with HTML.

Javascipt
=========
Javascipt was the last two weeks half of the class. It was more of an introduction to the world of JavaScript before
the later class CIS195 - Internet Programming 2, which came in spring 2018
